# Elizabeth Killgore Phase 2 Final Project Flatiron School 
This is a React single page application named "Great Paintings".

The purpose of this application is to appreciate chosen works of art of some of the "Great Masters" of painting in the Impressionist and Abstract genres.  Also, this application allows a user to contribute a favorite of their own.  

The user can click on Impressionist in the center list and be directed to the page for Impressionist paintings, and then click on Abstract in the list to be directed to the page for Abstract paintings.  Each of the those two pages display paintings with the title, artist and date for each work.  There is also a separate page for a user to submit their choice of an Impressionist painting via a form, and a separate page to submit an Abstract painting in the same way.  The user can fill out the information in the form for Artist, Title, Date and Image, and click on the "Add Painting" button, to add their own chosen work of art to be displayed in the Impressionist page or the Abtract page.

As a work in progress for school purposes, this project application is not open to contributions at this time.

In acknowledgement, I want to thank the Art Institute of Chicago for making the images displayed on this website available to be used freely by the public.
